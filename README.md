# ICT Infrastructure Analysis Noteboks 

## Notebooks used for ITU geospatial analysis Workshops and on-line training

Geospatial analysis using ICT infrastructure data and related data for solving connectivity barriers to hampering access to digital technologies to localities, public building (e.g. schools, health centers,), refugee camps and any other points of interest when connectivity analysis is needed. 

The following analysis modules used in this training consist of the following three components:  

1. Mapping of the population density around the connectivity targed;  

2. Visibility of the location (building, squares, etc) to telecommunication towers 

3. Estimation of the Fiber Path from a fiber node to the Point of Interest. 

A complete description on the algoritms will be soon be avaialbe in the ITU Academy portal - Self-Paced training on Advanced Broadband Mapping and geospatial analysis
