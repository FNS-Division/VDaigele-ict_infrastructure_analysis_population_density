# ICT Infrastructure Analysis Noteboks

Geospatial analysis using ICT infrastructure data and related data for solving connectivity barriers to hampering access to digital technologies to localities, public building (e.g. schools, health centers,), refugee camps and any other points of interest when connectivity analysis is needed. 

The current analysis modules consist of the following three components:  

1. Mapping of the population density around the connectivity targed;  

2. Visibility of the location (building, squares, etc) to telecommunication towers 

3. Estimation of the Fiber Path from a fiber node to the Point of Interest.
